phpIPAM is an open-source web IP address management application. 
However, its support for scanning hostnames, ports, and services is limited.
IPAMScanner compensates for this by scanning subnet hostnames and ports using multiple methods.
Currently, it operates by directly interacting with the database, though integration via API is also possible.
